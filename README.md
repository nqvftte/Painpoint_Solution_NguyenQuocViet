# 🧠 Pain Point to Feature Matching Agent

This repository contains the prototype implementation of an intelligent agent that takes a **business pain point** as input and suggests relevant **Filum.ai features** that can help solve it. The system combines **vector search**, **keyword search (BM25)**, and a **language model (LLM)** using the **LlamaIndex** framework.

### 💡 Example Pain Points and Outputs
🔹 **Example 1**  
🔍 **Input (pain point):** We're struggling to collect customer feedback consistently after a purchase.  
💬 **Output(matched feature):** Surveys (Voice of Customer) – How it helps: Collects customer feedback consistently after a purchase through automated surveys, providing valuable insights to improve customer experience.  

🔹 **Example 2**  
🔍 **Input (pain point):** Our support agents are overwhelmed by the high volume of repetitive questions.  
💬 **Output(matched feature):** AI Inbox (AI Customer Service) – How it helps: Automates responses to repetitive questions, reducing the workload of support agents and enabling them to focus on more complex issues.    

🔹 **Example 3**  
🔍 **Input (pain point):** We have no clear idea which customer touchpoints are causing the most frustration.  
💬 **Output(matched feature):** Experience (Insights) – How it helps: It provides insights into customer interactions across various touchpoints, helping identify which ones are causing the most frustration, and enabling data-driven decisions to improve customer experience.  

🔹 **Example 4**  
🔍 **Input (pain point):** It's difficult to get a single view of a customer's interaction history when they contact us.  
💬 **Output(matched feature):** Customers (Customer 360) – How it helps: Provides a unified view of customer interactions across multiple touchpoints, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of their interaction history.  

🔹 **Example 5**  
🔍 **Input (pain point):** Manually analyzing thousands of open-ended survey responses for common themes is too time-consuming.  
💬 **Output(matched feature):** Surveys (Voice of Customer) – How it helps: Automates the analysis of open-ended survey responses to quickly identify common themes, saving time and effort.
