# 🧠 Pain Point to Feature Matching Agent

This repository contains the prototype implementation of an intelligent agent that takes a **business pain point** as input and suggests relevant **Filum.ai features** that can help solve it. The system combines **vector search**, **keyword search (BM25)**, and a **language model (LLM)** using the **LlamaIndex** framework.
